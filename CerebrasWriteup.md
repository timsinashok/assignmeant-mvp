**AssignMeant: Personalized Assignment Generation Platform**

**Summary**
AssignMeant is an innovative ed-tech platform designed to personalize and streamline the assignment creation process. Using AI technology, teachers can upload chapter PDFs, and the system automatically generates questions tailored to individual students' past performance and interests. The platform is specifically built to accommodate diverse learning needs, supporting both high-performing students and those who may be struggling, including students with learning disabilities. By adapting to each student's capacity, AssignMeant ensures effective academic progress for all learners. The platform integrates key features like guided help and an autograder to improve learning efficiency and accessibility while helping teachers focus on teaching.

**How We Built It**
We developed the backend using Flask, which provides a robust framework for handling application logic. Initially, we built the application using SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL, but we encountered significant challenges when trying to deploy due to extensive file management requirements. This led us to switch to MongoDB as our database solution, chosen for its flexibility and scalability in managing diverse data formats, including user profiles, past scores, and uploaded PDFs. The core AI functionality is powered by the Llama 3.1 8B model accessed through Cerebras Inference, ensuring state-of-the-art question generation capabilities. For the frontend for mvp, we have plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with responsive design that allows both teachers and students to interact seamlessly across different devices, making the platform intuitive and accessible. I personally contributed to most of the backend and frontend development, while also assisting Manoj with setting up the AI integration.

**Leveraging Cerebras' Fast Inference**
Cerebras' fast inference capabilities have become central to AssignMeant's functionality. After initially building the app using the OpenAI API, we recently transitioned to Cerebras Inference and have been impressed by both its speed and response quality. We're leveraging Cerebras' fast inference to process large chapter PDFs and extract meaningful content in real-time, generating context-aware questions tailored to multiple students in each class. The speed of Cerebras Fast Inference is particularly critical as our userbase grows. The capable models like Llama 3 8B and Llama 3 70B are ideal for our needs, and access to a larger context window of 16k+ tokens would help us make this app the future of education. This integration also enhances other key features, such as quick guided help and fast autograder, delivering real-time support and feedback to students while ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience for both educators and learners.

**Future Roadmap**
AssignMeant originated as a pet project while all three of us - Ashok (me), Manoj, and Komal - were pursuing summer research. The project has grown through our steady contributions, and we're currently in communication with the Moses Centre at NYU. The Centre is conducting research on students with learning disabilities and has expressed interest in testing and developing a system like ours, potentially leading to collaboration in helping students with learning difficulties.

On the technical front, first of all we want to deploy the app asap, by the end of this year. We plan to enhance the platform by gamifying the learning process to make it more engaging, similar to Duolingo. We're developing advanced analytics dashboards to help teachers gain deeper insights into student progress and learning patterns. Multilingual support is also on our roadmap to make the platform accessible to a global audience. Additionally, we aim to further optimize our Cerebras API integration to handle the assignment generation more effeciently and support a larger user base. These enhancements will ensure AssignMeant continues to evolve as a leading tool for personalized education.
